This Eclipse Word Game 
 could be a nice addition to any science educators' curriculum. In this rendition of the hangman game, I created a vocabulary list that includes terminology describing eclipses.  
 This game can evolve into any subject matter. Feel free to share your science ideas with me, through email kpoeltler@gmail.com.
